*Yesterday*, I was invited to give a talk at the Zoology Department at the University of Oxford. Also I had the opportunity to meet and talk with Peter Holland, Seb Shimeld, and Aziz Aboobaker.
This was great fun and I got some really good feedback on my talk and my projects, as well as some very valuable career advice. I should really hope to get the opportunity to go back there soon for more discussions of Eco*Evo*Devo biology.

*Also* in Oxford, I could visit my sister and her husband.

_I love this picture, they have in their living room._

It is quite odd, one things Oxford is so close to London but from my flat in Finchley it is actually a three hour journey by bike, bus, and coach. But beeing there I could also visit friends, both biologists, who live in Oxford for about two years now. Always good to meet friends.
