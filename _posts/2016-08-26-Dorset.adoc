*Stayed a few days* in a very nice Air B&B in Bridport in beautiful Bridport.

*Paddleboarding* is real fun. Beeing a bit crazy I bought this *SUP* board in Bournemouth to pick it up on the way to Bridport. In the end this wasn't a good idea and I should have collected it a few weeks ago, but then using it was good fun indeed.

This is a sport I really do like and want to do more often.
