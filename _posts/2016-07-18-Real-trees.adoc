Now this is some real tree. Seen in Hampstead Heath last week. Wow!

We also went to the London Zoo, which is quite nicely embedded into Regents Park. However, it is also very, very expensive I have to say.

Anyway, the kids liked it. We even saw a tiger, and this guy later on - taking it easy in the sun.

Now I am already back in Germany, frantically putting results together for my poster for the EED conference in Uppsala next week. I have never been to Sweden, so am looking very much forward to the trip, expecially since I will be meeting an old friend from California in Stockholm on Monday. He has been working at a local natural history museum for 3 or 4 years now and I will spent the first night at his place. This way I guess, I'll also get a good tour of Stockholm, well, if I manage to finish my poster today. Have to finish today, as I am going on a short sailing trip with a very good friend of mine who has his own boat. Haven't been sailing for ages, so am pretty excited.
