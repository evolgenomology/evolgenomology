*Monday morning* I travelled to Stockholm, because I am attending the European EvoDevo conference in Uppsalla, which is north of Stockholm. I had never been to Sweden before, so this is quite exciting. In Stockholm I was hosted by friends, Alex and Nicole, who were my housemates during my stay at UC Riverside in 2009 - 2010. Alex, who is a nematode taxonomist, got a job at the Natural History Museum in Stockholm. My stay with them was very nice. Actually, I had to work on my poster for the conference, and did this on Monday. But in the afternoon we went out to the city, visit the Vasa museum, and had a picknick at the waterfront (apparently the Swedes like to picknick a lot, I think they call it "fikka", having coffee and some food outside).

*Today* then I finished my poster and we went to print it in the city. While the print shop was doing that Alex showed my parts of the museum and his office. Now I am very much looking forward to the conference. I am sure it will be scientifically exciting and I will also be able to meet some colleagues from Cologne, who are also attending.

*I quite* liked Uppsala. Think it is a very swedish city - just like you expect them to be.
