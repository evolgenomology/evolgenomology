= Not even wrong

Last week I 'had to' lend my helmet to my younger son and cycled back from work just with my cool Rapha cap. This was a bit scary in London and I think I won't do it again. But well, made it.

Saturday we went to the Natural History Museum and found this QTD in the Archway tube station. ;-)

They had a special exposition on light perception of/by animals in the museum, which actually opened on Saturday. So we were among the first to visit I guess. It is a bit pricy, for the ~half hour you need to walk through, but then a lot of effort was put into the movies I guess. Then again, these wer sponsored by some OLED screen builder.
Anyways, what I found a bit disappointing is this phylogenetic tree.

While they show all the polytomies (unresolved relationships) within Ecdysozoa (moulting animals like insects and roundworms) and Lophotrochozoa (e.g. snails, earthworms, squids), they firmly put our lab's pets, Xenoturbella and the acoel flatworms, as outgroup to all other bilaterian animals. This however, is still debated too. So, I guess the tree is not even wrong...
