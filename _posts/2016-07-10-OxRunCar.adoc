Decided to stay an extra night in Oxford.
Went running with my little sister today. Did 7k, quite fun.

Meanwhile people were having fun on the river.

Then, for whatever reason, there was a carnival here. Cowley Road Carnival. It is quite distinc from what we have back home of course, but people appeared to be enjoying themselves.
