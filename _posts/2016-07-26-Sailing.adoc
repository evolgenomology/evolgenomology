*Last* weekend I went sailing with a friend, who actually owns a small boat. We went to the Ijsselmeer in the Netherlands on Friday evening, a smoth 3 hour drive, and then had some beers and a real good chat about life and everything in the habour pub. Actually, we hadn't spoken like that for a very long time and I enjoyed it very much.

*The* next morning we went out and crossed the Ijsselmeer to Enkhuizen. There wasn't very much wind, but quite enough to hoist the sails and enjoy the peace and silence of travelling the water without the sound of an engine.

After a pleasent afternoon in a local caffee we had some Gin and Tonic and some more fun chatting about this and that.

*Unfortunately*, the journey back on the next day proved to be a biological experience. There was no wind and we got to know the Ijsselmeer flies, which apparently are known to most sailors there. They seem to appear in clouds on some days and indeed not only our boat, our sails, but also we were covered in them within minutes. I would guess introducing a nematode parasite killing these flies could be big buisiness. We were wondering if the eutrophic, virtually green water of the Ijsselmeer plays some part in the abundance of these critters.
