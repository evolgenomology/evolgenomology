*Yesterday*, I was invited to give a talk at the Zoology Department at the University of Oxford. Also I had the opportunity to meet and talk with Peter Holland, Seb Shimeld, and Aziz Aboobaker.
This was great fun and I got some really good feedback on my talk and my projects, as well as some very valuable career advice. I should really hope to get the opportunity to go back there soon for more discussions of Eco*Evo*Devo biology, especially as my research questions appear to align very well with what is done in that department.

*Also* in Oxford, I could visit my sister and her husband.

_I love this picture, they have in their living room._

It is quite odd, one tends to think Oxford is so close to London but from my flat in Finchley it is actually a three hour journey by bike, bus, and coach. So, after arriving at 1am on Sunday at my flat, leaving for Oxford at noon that day, and coming back Monday at 9pm I was quite tired. 
Still, beeing there I could also visit friends, both biologists, who live in Oxford for about two years now. It is always good to meet friends. And so it was all worth the effort.
