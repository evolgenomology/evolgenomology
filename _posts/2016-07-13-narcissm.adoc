My sister accused me of narcissism, because of my second post on the quadruplexes last week. I tried to explain to her that making fun of onself is an important thing to do, but she said that could also be seen as narcissim then. Left me defenseless as ever so often...

_So what if I say I'd wear a skirt like this, just not the flower in my hair._ ;-)

_Puuuh, running this weekend was quite exhausting really, I can still feel it. Sometimes I think I should go back to my more sloth-ee self._

_And just dring coffee._

Meanwhile, my family is coming tomorrow and I will discuss some Minecraft with my son, maybe just not this book, I saw in Oxford yesterday.
