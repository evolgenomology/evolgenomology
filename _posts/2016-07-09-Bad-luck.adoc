Huh! Somebody got bad luck here.

Quite happy that my bike is parked indoors at UCL when I see this. In principle I have to say however, that London drivers, and especially the bus drivers are quite fair. So I'd say cylcing to work isn't more dangerous than, say, it was in Cologne.
This morning I saw that there are even bike shelters at Stansted airport, but it is 39mi from here. Bit too much I fear...

Meanwhile, my good friend Johannes has a birthday today. So, __happy birthday Jojo!__ Already looking forward to our sailing trip in two weeks time.
