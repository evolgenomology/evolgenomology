Yesterday evening I went home for a short visit and am now already back in London. Bit of a pity, since the weather in Cologne was quite nice. Warm summer. Flying into London everything was grey, but now it is clearing up a bit.
I will spend the weekend grant writing at my sister's place in Oxford. We also plan to do some running. Quite curious to see if I can manage 10k in my current state. Also they have been training a lot since I last was there, so I might just fall over an let them carry me to the couch.

I quite like the Stanstead City Link bus service. It is great value for money. On Tuesday, when I came here I actually had a chat with the driver for the full journey. Was a lot of fun.
