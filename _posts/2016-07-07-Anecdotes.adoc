Today I saw two pics on Twitter posted by John Moffitt. I quite liked them.

=== Anecdotal evidence

This one (https://twitter.com/JohnRMoffitt/status/750807415990263808) is certainly true, and extends far into real life. People so often think things, also about themselves, which are based on very insufficient observations. Not that I would make myself free of this. Quite to the contrary.
But it drives me crazy time after time. Especially, how people build their own reality. This is also nicely explained the book "Thinking Fast and Slow" by Danieal Kahneman. Something everybody should read.

=== Purity of Science
Well, the only thing I can say "My Head is an Animal", and I am quite happy to be a biologist in this comparison. What is better than fiddling with a squid, if you feel like it?
